# architecture (linux/amd64 on GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest). TARGETARCH is
# still set from buildx's --platform flag, so `go build` cross-compiles
# natively for the target arch instead of running the entire Go compiler
# under QEMU emulation. Without this directive, arm64 builds took ~40 min
# under QEMU; with it, ~20s.

# the GOARCH has not a default value to allow the binary be built according to the host where the command
# was called. For example, if we call make docker-build in a local env which has the Apple Silicon M1 SO
# the docker BUILDPLATFORM arg will be linux/arm64 when for Apple x86 it will be linux/amd64. Therefore,
# by leaving it empty we can ensure that the container and binary shipped on it will have the same platform.
